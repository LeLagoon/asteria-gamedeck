I made this gamedeck to create a base and an idea for a game about exploring the underwater city called "Asteria". You play as Vedika and you explore the city to find cryptic clues and uncover it's greek past. The game is divided in 5 Levels or 5 floors which you have to conquer and after each level you get a piece of paper that contains hieroglyphs about the city's history. At the end you rearrange them to uncover the real story.


The Story goes like -
Vedika boarded her submarine and went down to the exact location that the magnetometer reported. She was shocked to discover that her theory was, in fact, true, right in front of her stood the city in all its glory. Well, whatever glory an old, grimy, demolished, Greek city could have.

She brought her submarine down to the sea bed and exited the submarine. Vedika shovelled her equipment in her backpack and swam towards what was most likely the city. She walked on the sandy shore of the city. She looked inside her backpack but one look at her equipment told her that they were of no use now, the electromagnetic waves were too much to handle and were enough to give her a headache as well.

Vedika took a step back and looked up to finally get a good view of the city. Grimy. Rusted. Demolished. But, majestic. The city was almost in the shape of a rectangle except for a few ridges here and there. The border of the entire city was lined with small little houses and shops made of nothing much but mudbrick and clay with stone as the foundation and a little bit of wood here and there for support. The only problem was that the wood rotted in the water and the bricks had given up and broken into small little pieces. While algae had found its way all around the city, especially the stone pavement which was nothing short of a jungle. 

Paths had been built all around the city but all of them led to one thing- a huge building right in the centre of the city. The structure was easily eight stories tall and was supported by pillars on every single level. It looked like the pillars would give in at any moment and the whole building would tumble down. The pillars themselves looked like they were made of bronze and steel. The steel rusted and the bronze turned green over decades of degradation and oxidation. 

Exactly then, Vedika realised that she was underwater but she was still standing up and breathing like she would on land. That’s when she realised that an enormous bubble surrounded the entire area and there was no way that she could exit the city and because there was no water, her submarine was no more than a lump of metal. Vedika had a new problem at hand now, to escape.

So she did the obvious and walked towards the huge building in the centre irrespective of whatever she might face. As Vedika neared the building she found two statues of what looked like gods, right in front of the building, three but the third was nothing more than clumps of rocks. Underneath the statues was something written in what seemed like Ancient Greek. “Αστέρια” and “Πέρσες”. 

One thing seemed clear to Vedika, the city right in front of her was no ordinary city. It was a forgotten Greek city which most probably belonged to the gods whose statues she was standing right in front of. But there had to be some reason because of which this city was down here and ruined. There was no way that this was built underwater and this certainly didn’t seem like Poseidon’s work.  A huge signboard hung from a pole which read something in Ancient Greek but also in English. “Αστέρια” or “Asteria”. Vedika guessed that the city’s name was Asteria. 

Vedika entered the building squeezing past the pillars. The entire place stank of dead mice and rotten cardboard for some reason and strangely there was a strong smell of sulphur in the air as well. The roof looked like it would fall apart any moment but the room in itself was empty except for a pair of metal doors at the end of the room. 

The metal doors were the only thing in the whole place that were not rusted or entangled in algae. The entire building suddenly started trembling as the metal doors opened with a ding. It was an elevator. How? Vedika had no idea. She stepped inside and found that there were only 5 floors. But only the button with the number 1 on it was lit up while the others had no light. Vedika pressed the button. The machine whirred to life and lifted off of the ground.
